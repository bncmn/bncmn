# 👋 Hi there, nice to meet you!

I'm a 4th year Computing Science student at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), and I am projected to graduate this coming Fall of 2024.
I'm currently exploring the many fields that Computer Science has to offer, and have found interests in **embedded development**, **web design**, and **data science and engineering**!

## A few things about me!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning [embedded development](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/spring/cmpt/433/d100) and [cloud computing](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/spring/cmpt/474/d100).
- 📋 I'm currently helping a friend grow his [small business](https://convivial.ca/)!
- 🇵🇭 My family and I moved to Canada from the Philippines in 2013.
- 💻 I love tinkering with electronics!
