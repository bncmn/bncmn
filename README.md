# 👋 Hi there, nice to meet you!

I graduated from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/) in September 2024. 
I'm passionate about anything computers and tech-related and I am super stoked to be exploring the ever-changing field of technology!

Below, you will find some of the projects I have worked on.
These consist of projects done on in my own time, with friends, and for school.
