# 👋 Hi there, nice to meet you!

I'm a 4th year Computing Science student at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/), and I am projected to graduate this coming Fall of 2024.
I'm currently exploring the many fields that Computer Science has to offer, and have found interests in **embedded development**, **web design**, and **data science and engineering**!

## A few things about me!

- 🇵🇭 My family and I moved to Canada from the Philippines in 2013.
