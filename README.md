# 👋 Hi there! I'm Diego Buencamino!

I'm a 4th year Computing Science student at [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca/)!
I'm currently exploring the many fields that Computer Science has to offer, and have found interests in **embedded development**, **data science**, and **web design**!

## A few things about me!
- 🌱 I'm currently learning [embedded development](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/spring/cmpt/433/d100) and [cloud computing](https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2024/spring/cmpt/433/d100).
- 💻 I'm passionate about coding cool projects and tinkering with electronics.
- 📋 I'm currently helping a friend grow his [small business](https://convivial.ca/)!
- 🏂 In the winters, you can find me snowboarding!

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/bncmn), on [Discord](https://discord.com/): `0df`, or via email: `d.bncmn@gmail.com`!

Below, you will find some of the projects I have worked on!
